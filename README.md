## Description

A single-page application portfolio for a web developer that contains a header, a section for content, and a footer.

When a user clicks on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

The Portfolio section includes titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

The Contact section features contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
